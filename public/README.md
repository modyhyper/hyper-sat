## Required Logo Files

Please place the following logo files in this directory:

### Main Logo
- **`logo.png`** - Full Hyper TV logo (TV icon + text) for use in Navigation and Footer
  - Recommended size: ~200px width, maintain aspect ratio
  - Format: PNG with transparency
  - Optimized for web use

### Favicon Files
- **`favicon.ico`** - Traditional favicon (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes)
- **`icon.png`** - Standard favicon (32x32)
- **`icon-192.png`** - PWA icon (192x192)
- **`icon-512.png`** - PWA icon (512x512)
- **`apple-icon.png`** - Apple touch icon (180x180)

### Favicon Creation Instructions

The favicon should be extracted from the blue 'H' letter in the logo:
1. Extract just the 'H' letter from the logo
2. Create a clean, standalone icon
3. Ensure it's visible on both light and dark backgrounds
4. Optimize for small sizes (32x32 minimum)

## Image Optimization

For best performance:
- Use PNG format for logos with transparency
- Consider WebP format for better compression
- Ensure all images are optimized (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
- Keep file sizes under 100KB when possible
